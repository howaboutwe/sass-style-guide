## A Primer from the Sass Way

* While there are lessons we've learned in the trenches, start with [this guide from the Sass way](http://thesassway.com/articles/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do)

## Classes

* CamelCase everything.  Not **snake_cased_name**.  Not **lowerCameCase**. Not **wHat_EVerThis_is**.  Just CamelCase.

## Compass

* [Use it!](http://compass-style.org/)  When you do you'll want to keep the following things in mind:
  * TDB

## Includes

* TDB...but use them!

## Extends

* [Beware of inception style selectors.](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule)
* Never extend something that is already using an @extend

## Mixins
