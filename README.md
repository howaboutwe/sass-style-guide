## A Primer from the Sass Way

* While there are lessons we've learned in the trenches, start with [this guide from the Sass way](http://thesassway.com/articles/sass-doesnt-create-bad-code-bad-coders-do)

## Cleanup Rules

* If you find Sass that violates any the rules in this style guide while completing your story:
  * donâ€™t do if behind on sprint or points for that story
  * limit yourself to 30 mins - 1 hour

## Classes

* CamelCase everything.  Not **snake_cased_name**.  Not **lowerCameCase**. Not **wHat_EVerThis_is**.  Just CamelCase.

## Nesting

* [Beware of inception style selectors.](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule)  
* In short, don't mirror your nested selectors to mirror your markup's nesting.

## Compass

* [Use it!](http://compass-style.org/)  When you do you'll want to keep the following things in mind:
  * TDB

## Includes

* TDB...but use them!

## Extends

* Never extend something that is already using an @extend
* TBD

## Mixins

* TBD
